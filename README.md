# Development docker-compose template

This is template for new php project with docker usages. It used to fast pet-project infrastructure set up with docker-compose.

1. git clone
2. add source code as though it's local project (for example - app directory with some code)
3. check docker-compose configuration
4. go to terminal and run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Open you browser by `localhost:8086` and it would work now!
